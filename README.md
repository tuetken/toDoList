This will be the first project I build to strengthen my full stack abilities.

The goal of this project is to gain experience in JavaScript by working with storage types and rehearsing my html/css.

I also want to use git/github to track changes instead of constantly making changes locally. I understand for a project of this size that is not necessary, however it's in my interest to follow best practices regardless, as those will transfer better for bigger builds later on.
